# NQueens Puzzle

Place n non-attacking queens on an nxn chessboard

Overview
-----
Uses local search algorithms to search for solutions in the state space. Local search demonstrates that modifying states can be more practical than using an initial state to search for solutions. Local search is used when the path to the solution isn't important. Local search can find solutions in large or infinite state spaces that are continuous.
